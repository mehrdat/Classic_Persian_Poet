**Persian Classic Poet Generator GPT**
This is a tiny model to generate Persian classic poetry, and the model was adapted from "nanoGPT" by Andrej Karpathy.

The model I did on CPU and I will run on GPU and will put better results. I did not change the model so much,
BUT to make it a better model to get the best result for Farsi it needs some trivial changes.
